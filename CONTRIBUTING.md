Before reading, you may know what [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is and what it does. In short, it's a CLI (Command Line Interface) program written in python, which lets you download videos from [1000+ websites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

For bug reports and feature requests, please search in issues first (including the closed ones). If there're no duplicates, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal/issues/new) with an issue template.

**We'll probably ignore and close your issue if it's not using the existing templates or doesn't contain sufficient description.**

For questions or any other ideas to improve, you can join our official [Telegram group](https://t.me/seal_app_group) or [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#seal-space:matrix.org).


## Disclaimer

This is a toy project I use to learn Android development. Please do not have any expectations or assumptions about the quality of the code.


## Bug Report

When submitting a bug report, please make sure your issue contains **enough** information for reproducing the problem, including the options or the custom command being used, the link to the video, and other fields in the issue template.



## Feature Request

Seal is and will remain a simple GUI for yt-dlp, providing most of the functionality of yt-dlp as is, without modifications. Thus, **we'll not take requests for features that yt-dlp does not support.**

The app has two download modes: 

- General mode: Save as audio, download playlist, and many other options that can be used individually or combined for normal download tasks. Once the download is complete, Seal will scan the files into the system media library, and store them in the download history.
- Custom command mode: For advanced usage of yt-dlp, a user can create and store multiple command templates in the app, then select and use one of them directly to execute the yt-dlp command like in a terminal. In this mode, all of the GUI options and features in the general mode will be disabled.

Since most of the functions can be implemented in custom command mode, the "feature request" would be treated as adding a shortcut to the general mode. However, not all feature requests will be accepted and implemented in the app. [Why not add an option for that?](https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2018/07/options.html)
