## Features

- Download videos and audio files from video platforms supported by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

- Embed metadata and video thumbnail into extracted audio files supported by [mutagen](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen).

- Download all videos in playlist in one click

- Execute custom yt-dlp command with template.

- Manage in-app downloads.

- Easy to use and user-friendly.

- [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) style UI, with [dynamic color](https://m3.material.io/foundations/customization) theme (~~is this really needed in a video downloader?~~)

- MAD: UI and logic written with pure Kotlin. Single activity, no fragments but composable destinations.
